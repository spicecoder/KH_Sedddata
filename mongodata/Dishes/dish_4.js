  "ingredients": [
    "2 6-oz boneless chicken breasts",
    "2 tsp fresh lemon juice",
    "sea salt and pepper to taste",
    "1-2 cloves garlic, pressed or finely chopped",
    "3 TBS extra virgin olive oil",
    "2 tsp fresh lemon juice",
    "sea salt and pepper to taste"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Preheat the broiler on high and place an all stainless steel skillet (be sure the handle is also stainless steel) or cast iron pan about 6 inches from the heat for about 10 minutes to get it very hot.",
    "While the pan is heating, rinse and pat the chicken dry and season with lemon juice, salt, and pepper.",
    "Leaving the skin on, place the breast skin side up on the hot pan and return it to the oven. It is not necessary to turn the breast because it is cooking on both sides at once. Depending on the size, it should be cooked in about 7 minutes. Remove the skin before serving; it is left on to keep it moist while broiling. The breast is done when it is moist, yet its liquid runs clear when pierced. The inside temperature needs to reach 165°F (74⪚C).",
    "Dress with garlic, lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil, salt, and pepper to taste. Add rosemary, sage, or Dijon mustard to the dressing if desired. You can also top with sauteed mushrooms for extra flavor."
