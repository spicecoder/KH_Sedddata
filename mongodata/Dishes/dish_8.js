  "description": "Saucy, smothered, hearty, and delicious: This enchilada bake has everything you could possibly want. You’ll make it by wrapping tortillas around a filling of poblano pepper, tomato, and beans, then coating the bundles with a healthy glug of mild green salsa and a sprinkle of Monterey Jack cheese. Put it in the oven and let it get piping hot and bubbly, and all you’ll have left to do is add a drizzle of spiced sour cream and dig in to that deliciousness.",

  "instructions": [
    " Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 475 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. • Core, deseed, and dice poblano. Finely dice tomato. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Drain beans over a small bowl, reserving liquid. Thinly slice chili.",
    " Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add poblano and cook until just softened, 3-4 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, reserve ½ tsp Southwest Spice (1 tsp for 4 servings) in a second small bowl for step 6. • Once poblano is just softened, add tomato, scallion whites, half the beans, 2 TBSP reserved bean liquid (you’ll use the remaining beans and more bean liquid in the next step), and remaining Southwest Spice to pan. Cook, stirring, until fragrant and warmed through, 2-3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.",
    " Heat a large drizzle of oil in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add remaining beans and cook, stirring, until slightly softened, 2-3 minutes. Add 3 TBSP reserved bean liquid (1⁄3 cup for 4 servings). (You may have some bean liquid left over.) • Simmer until warmed through, 1-2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir in 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4). • Turn off heat; mash with a potato masher or fork until mostly smooth. Season with plenty of salt and pepper.",
    "Spread tortillas with mashed beans. Place a small amount of filling on one half of each tortilla. Roll up tortillas, starting with filled sides, and place seam sides down in an 8-by-11-inch baking dish or ovenproof pan. (For 4 servings, place in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish or two smaller ones.) Spoon enough salsa over to generously coat (you may have some left over). Sprinkle with Monterey Jack. • Bake on top rack until salsa is bubbly and cheese melts, 3-5 minutes.",
    " While enchiladas bake, add sour cream to bowl with reserved Southwest Spice. Stir in warm water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. Season with salt and pepper. • Top baked enchiladas with crema, scallion greens, and as much chili as you like. Divide between plates and serve."
